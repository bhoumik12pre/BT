Perfect 👏 — let’s break down **exactly how the output of your N-Queens program** is coming, step by step,
using your sample example 👇

---

### 🧩 Input:

```
Enter the size of the chessboard (N): 4
Enter the column number (0 to N-1) to place the first Queen: 1
```

This means:

* You’re working with a **4×4 chessboard**.
* The **first queen** is already placed at **row 0, column 1**.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Initial Chessboard

After placing the first queen manually:

```
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

Here `1` represents a **queen**, and `0` means **empty cell**.
So currently, there’s a queen at `(row 0, column 1)`.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Start Backtracking from Row 1

The algorithm now tries to place a queen in **row 1**.

### Row 1 possibilities:

| Column | Safe? | Reason                                |
| :----- | :---- | :------------------------------------ |
| 0      | ✅     | Not same column, no diagonal conflict |
| 1      | ❌     | Same column as first queen            |
| 2      | ❌     | Same diagonal as first queen          |
| 3      | ✅     | No conflict                           |

Algorithm tries **column 0 first**, but later finds it leads to dead end, so it **backtracks**.
Then it tries **column 3**, which works successfully.

Now board looks like:

```
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Move to Row 2

Now it tries to place the **third queen** in **row 2**.

### Row 2 possibilities:

| Column | Safe? | Reason                           |
| :----- | :---- | :------------------------------- |
| 0      | ✅     | No conflict                      |
| 1      | ❌     | Attacked by diagonal from (1, 3) |
| 2      | ❌     | Attacked by diagonal from (0, 1) |
| 3      | ❌     | Same column as (1, 3)            |

✅ So the algorithm places a queen at `(2, 0)`.

Board now:

```
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Move to Row 3

Now for **row 3**, check all columns:

| Column | Safe? | Reason                |
| :----- | :---- | :-------------------- |
| 0      | ❌     | Same column as (2, 0) |
| 1      | ❌     | Diagonal from (2, 0)  |
| 2      | ✅     | No conflict           |
| 3      | ❌     | Diagonal from (1, 3)  |

✅ So we place the last queen at `(3, 2)`.

Final board:

```
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
```

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Base Case Reached

Now **row = 4 (equal to N)** → all queens are placed successfully.
So, the function prints:

```
One of the possible solutions:
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
```

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Why is it called a “safe” configuration?

In this solution:

* No two queens share the **same row** ✅
* No two queens share the **same column** ✅
* No two queens share the **same diagonal** ✅

Hence, this arrangement is a **valid N-Queens solution**.

---

## 🔹 Step 7: How the Backtracking Works

1️⃣ The program places a queen in the **first available safe column** in each row.
2️⃣ If it reaches a row where **no safe position exists**, it goes **back (backtracks)** to the previous row,
removes that queen, and tries the next column.
3️⃣ Once all queens are placed safely, it prints the final board.

## 🔹 Example Summary

| Step | Row | Column Chosen | Reason                           |
| :--- | :-: | :-----------: | :------------------------------- |
| 1    |  0  |       1       | Given manually                   |
| 2    |  1  |       3       | Safe after checking conflicts    |
| 3    |  2  |       0       | Safe position                    |
| 4    |  3  |       2       | Safe position                    |
| ✅    |  -  |       -       | All 4 queens placed successfully |

## 🔹 Output Recap

```
Initial board with first Queen placed:
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

One of the possible solutions:
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
```

### 🧠 Time & Space Complexity (Recap)

| Type      | Complexity                                                | Reason                                                    |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**  | O(N!)                                                     | Because it tries every possible combination in worst case |
| **Space** | O(N²)** (for board)** or **O(N)** (if using column lists) | Stores the chessboard matrix                              |

---

✅ **Final Explanation:**

> The program uses **backtracking** to place N queens on an N×N board so that no two queens threaten each other.
> Starting with the first queen (already placed), it tries to safely place one queen in each row.
> It backtracks whenever a conflict occurs and stops when all queens are placed safely.

Would you like me to show what happens if you choose a **different starting column** for the first queen (e.g., column 0 or 2), so you can see how the pattern of backtracking changes?
