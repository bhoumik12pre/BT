🧠 Code Explanation (Line-by-Line Logic)
Step	Concept	Explanation
1️⃣	Structure	A struct named Student stores data for each student (ID, name, age, course).
2️⃣	Array	A dynamic array students[] holds multiple Student records.
3️⃣	addStudent()	Adds new student details into the array using memory allocation.
4️⃣	getStudent()	Retrieves a student’s details using the index in the array.
5️⃣	fallback()	Automatically executes when someone sends Ether to the contract or calls an invalid function.
6️⃣	receive()	Called when Ether is sent without any data. Used for receiving funds.
7️⃣	getContractBalance()	Returns the total Ether stored in the contract (to check gas usage or deposits).
⚙️ How to Deploy & Test (in Remix IDE)

1️⃣ Go to 👉 https://remix.ethereum.org

2️⃣ Create a new file named StudentData.sol
3️⃣ Paste the full code above
4️⃣ Compile using version 0.8.0 or higher
5️⃣ Deploy using Remix VM (London)
6️⃣ After deployment, test with following:

🧩 Example Test
➊ Add Student

Call:

addStudent(1, "Alice", 20, "Blockchain")
addStudent(2, "Bob", 22, "Machine Learning")

➋ Retrieve Student

Call:

getStudent(0)


Output:

1, "Alice", 20, "Blockchain"

➌ Test Fallback Function

Go to “Deploy & Run Transactions” →
In “Value” field, enter 1 ether,
and click Transact (without any function selected).

💡 The fallback function will execute and accept the Ether.
Now check balance:

getContractBalance()


Output → 1000000000000000000 wei (i.e., 1 Ether)

📊 Observation: Transaction Fee & Gas
Operation	Action	Approx Gas Used	Description
Deploy Contract	Deploy StudentData.sol	~250,000 gas	One-time deployment cost
Add Student	addStudent()	~60,000 gas	Storing data costs gas
Get Student	getStudent()	~25,000 gas	Reading data (view function, no fee)
Fallback Trigger	Sending Ether	~21,000 gas	Executes fallback and stores value

(Gas used values may vary slightly in your Remix environment.)

🧮 Gas Fee Formula
Total Fee = Gas Used × Gas Price


Example:
If Gas Used = 60,000 and Gas Price = 20 Gwei,
then
Fee = 60,000 × 20 × 10⁻⁹ = 0.0012 ETH

🧠 Viva Questions
Question	Short Answer
What is a struct in Solidity?	A structure groups multiple data types together under one name.
Why use arrays?	To store multiple student records dynamically.
What is a fallback function?	It executes automatically when an unknown function is called or Ether is sent.
Difference between fallback() and receive()?	receive() handles plain Ether transfers, while fallback() handles invalid calls or extra data.
What is address(this).balance?	It gives the total Ether stored in the contract.
Why do write operations cost gas?	Because they change blockchain state permanently.
✅ Result / Conclusion

Successfully implemented and deployed a Student Data Smart Contract using
👉 Structures, Arrays, and Fallback functions.
Observed gas consumption and transaction fees for various operations.
