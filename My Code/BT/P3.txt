Absolutely 👍 — let’s go through your **Bank Account Smart Contract** line by line in a clear **student-friendly explanation**,
so you’ll fully understand what each part does and can easily explain it during your **viva** or **practical exam**.

## 🧠 **Step-by-Step Explanation**

### 🟩 1️⃣ License and Compiler Version

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

* `SPDX-License-Identifier`: tells that the code uses an MIT open-source license.
* `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;` ensures this contract works on compiler version **0.8.0 or above**.
  It helps avoid compatibility issues.

---

### 🟩 2️⃣ Contract Declaration

```solidity
contract BankAccount {
```

* Everything inside this block defines the smart contract called `BankAccount`.
* Think of it as a **class** in object-oriented programming.

---

### 🟩 3️⃣ State Variables

```solidity
address public customer;
uint256 private balance;
```

* `address`: a special data type in Solidity that stores **Ethereum wallet addresses**.
* `customer`: stores the address of the person who owns this bank account (the contract deployer).
* `uint256`: an unsigned integer (used to store Ether amount in **wei**).
* `private balance`: holds the **current balance** of the account.

  * `private` means other contracts can’t access it directly.

---

### 🟩 4️⃣ Constructor

```solidity
constructor() {
    customer = msg.sender;
    balance = 0;
}
```

* The **constructor** runs **only once**, when the contract is deployed.
* `msg.sender` = the Ethereum address that deployed the contract.
* So whoever deploys the contract automatically becomes the **owner/customer**.
* Sets the starting balance to `0`.

🧩 Example:
If you deploy the contract using your MetaMask account `0xABC...123`,
then `customer = 0xABC...123`.

---

### 🟩 5️⃣ Deposit Function

```solidity
function deposit() public payable {
    require(msg.sender == customer, "Only the account owner can deposit.");
    require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero.");
    balance += msg.value;
}
```

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Allows the owner to deposit Ether (cryptocurrency) into the contract.
* The keyword **`payable`** is necessary to receive Ether.
* `msg.value` stores the **amount of Ether sent** (in wei).

#### 🔹 Line-by-line:

1. `require(msg.sender == customer, "Only the account owner can deposit.");`
   → Only the account owner can make a deposit.

2. `require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be greater than zero.");`
   → Prevents depositing zero Ether (meaningless).

3. `balance += msg.value;`
   → Adds the deposited amount to the stored balance.

---

### 🟩 6️⃣ Withdraw Function

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == customer, "Only the account owner can withdraw.");
    require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance.");
    balance -= amount;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Lets the customer withdraw a specified amount of Ether from the account.

#### 🔹 Line-by-line:

1. `require(msg.sender == customer, "Only the account owner can withdraw.");`
   → Ensures only the account owner can withdraw.

2. `require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance.");`
   → Prevents withdrawing more than available.

3. `balance -= amount;`
   → Deducts withdrawn Ether from internal balance.

4. `payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);`
   → Sends the requested Ether amount back to the user’s wallet.

🧩 Example:
If balance = 5 ETH, and you call `withdraw(2 ETH)`
→ 2 ETH is transferred to your wallet,
and the stored balance becomes 3 ETH.

---

### 🟩 7️⃣ Show Balance Function

```solidity
function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
    require(msg.sender == customer, "Only the account owner can view balance.");
    return balance;
}
```

#### 🔍 What it does:

* Returns the customer’s current balance in **wei**.
* Marked as **`view`** because it does not change blockchain state (no gas fee).

🧩 Example:
If your account balance is 2 ETH, it will show:
`2000000000000000000 wei` (since 1 ETH = 10¹⁸ wei).

---

### 🟩 8️⃣ Access Control (Security Logic)

* Only **the owner (customer)** can deposit, withdraw, or view balance.
* This is enforced using the `require()` statements that check `msg.sender`.

## ⚙️ **How It Works Together (Step-by-Step Flow)**

| Step | Action          | What Happens                                        |
| :--- | :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Deploy Contract | You become `customer`; balance = 0                  |
| 2    | Deposit         | You send Ether; `balance += msg.value`              |
| 3    | Withdraw        | You request amount; Ether sent; `balance -= amount` |
| 4    | Get Balance     | Function returns stored balance in wei              |

---

## 🧪 **Example in Remix IDE**

1️⃣ Deploy contract.
→ `customer = 0xYourAddress`
→ `balance = 0`

2️⃣ Call `deposit()` and enter **Value: 2 ether**
→ `balance = 2 ether`

3️⃣ Call `withdraw(1000000000000000000)` (1 ETH in wei)
→ `balance = 1 ether`

4️⃣ Call `getBalance()`
→ Returns `1000000000000000000`

## 🧮 **Extra Notes (for Viva)**

| Question                          | Short Answer                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Why do we use `require()`?        | To enforce conditions before executing function logic. |
| What does `msg.sender` represent? | The address that initiated the transaction.            |
| What is the purpose of `payable`? | Allows a function or address to receive Ether.         |
| What is stored in `balance`?      | The internal record of deposited Ether.                |
| How is Ether unit stored?         | As **wei** (1 ETH = 10¹⁸ wei).                         |

---

✅ **Summary:**
This smart contract acts as a **mini bank** on Ethereum,
allowing a single user (the contract owner) to **deposit, withdraw, and check balance** securely using blockchain transactions.

---

Would you like me to show how to **extend this contract** to support **multiple customers** (so each wallet has its own account inside one contract)?
It’s a small but impressive upgrade often asked in viva or advanced lab exams.
