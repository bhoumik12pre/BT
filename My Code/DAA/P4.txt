Perfect 👏 — let’s go step-by-step and understand **how your 0/1 Knapsack output** is coming.

We’ll use the same input example from the program:

---

### 🧩 **Input:**

```
Number of items: 3
Item 1: value = 60, weight = 10
Item 2: value = 100, weight = 20
Item 3: value = 120, weight = 30
Knapsack capacity = 50
```

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Problem Recap

We need to select **some (or all)** of these 3 items so that:

* Total weight ≤ 50
* Total value is **maximum**
* We can only take an item **fully (1)** or **not at all (0)** → no fractions allowed.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Building the DP Table

We make a **DP matrix** where:

* Rows → items (from 0 to n)
* Columns → capacities (from 0 to W)

`dp[i][w]` = maximum value we can achieve
using first `i` items with capacity `w`.

Initially, every `dp[0][w] = 0` (no items → no value).

---

### 🧠 Formula:

For every item `i` and capacity `w`:

```
if weight[i-1] <= w:
   dp[i][w] = max( value[i-1] + dp[i-1][w - weight[i-1]],   # include item
                   dp[i-1][w] )                             # exclude item
else:
   dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]                                    # can't include item
```

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Fill the DP Table Step-by-Step

### Item 1 → value=60, weight=10

* Can fit in any capacity ≥ 10
  → So from capacity 10 to 50, we can carry value 60

After item 1:

```
dp[1][10..50] = 60
```

---

### Item 2 → value=100, weight=20

Now we have two choices for each capacity:

* If capacity < 20 → can’t include item 2, so same as before.
* If capacity ≥ 20 → choose between including item 2 or not.

Let’s check:

| Capacity |                Include item 2?                | dp[i][w] value |
| :------: | :-------------------------------------------: | :------------: |
|    10    |                 ❌ (too heavy)                 |       60       |
|    20    |                 ✅ max(100, 60)                |       100      |
|    30    | ✅ max(100 + dp[1][10]=60, dp[1][30]=60) = 160 |                |
|    40    | ✅ max(100 + dp[1][20]=60, dp[1][40]=60) = 160 |                |
|    50    | ✅ max(100 + dp[1][30]=60, dp[1][50]=60) = 160 |                |

So after item 2:

```
dp[2][50] = 160
```

---

### Item 3 → value=120, weight=30

Again, try to include or exclude:

| Capacity | Include?                                              | Calculation | Result |
| :------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :----: |
| 10       | ❌                                                     | too heavy   |   60   |
| 20       | ❌                                                     | too heavy   |   100  |
| 30       | ✅ max(120, 160 from prev)                             | 160         |        |
| 40       | ✅ max(120 + dp[2][10]=60, dp[2][40]=160) = 180        |             |        |
| 50       | ✅ max(120 + dp[2][20]=100, dp[2][50]=160) = **220** ✅ |             |        |

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Final DP Table Result

The last cell `dp[3][50]` = **220**

This means:

> The **maximum value** we can achieve for 3 items with capacity 50 is **220**.

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Which items were chosen?

To get total = 220:

* Item 3 (weight 30, value 120) → included
* Item 2 (weight 20, value 100) → included
* Item 1 (weight 10) → not included (would exceed capacity if added)

Total weight = 20 + 30 = 50
Total value = 100 + 120 = **220**

✅ Fits exactly, uses full capacity.

---

### ✅ Final Output Explanation:

```
Maximum value that can be placed in the knapsack = 220
```

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Time & Space Complexity Explanation

| Concept               | Explanation                                     |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Time Complexity:**  | O(n × W) — we fill each cell in DP table once.  |
| **Space Complexity:** | O(n × W) — DP table of size (items × capacity). |

---

### 🧠 Simple Viva Explanation:

> “The program uses a DP table to test every item and capacity combination.
> For each item, we decide whether to include it or not based on which gives higher value.
> For the given input, the algorithm selects item 2 and 3 giving a maximum total value of 220.”

Would you like me to **add a version that also prints which exact items are chosen** (not just the final value)?
That’s a nice addition if your teacher asks *“which items make up the optimal knapsack?”*
