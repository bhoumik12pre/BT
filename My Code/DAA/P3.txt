Excellent 👏 — let’s go step by step and see **exactly how your Fractional Knapsack output is coming**, using the **same example you ran**:

---

### 🧩 Input:

```
Number of items = 3

Item 1: value = 60,  weight = 10  
Item 2: value = 100, weight = 20  
Item 3: value = 120, weight = 30  

Knapsack capacity = 50
```

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Calculate value/weight ratio for each item

| Item | Value | Weight | Ratio (value ÷ weight) |
| :--- | :---: | :----: | :--------------------: |
| 1    |   60  |   10   |         **6.0**        |
| 2    |  100  |   20   |         **5.0**        |
| 3    |  120  |   30   |         **4.0**        |

✅ The **higher the ratio**, the **better the value per unit weight** —
so the algorithm will **pick items in descending order of ratio**:
→ Item 1 → Item 2 → Item 3.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Sort by ratio (Greedy strategy)

Sorted order (highest ratio first):

```
Item 1 → ratio 6.0
Item 2 → ratio 5.0
Item 3 → ratio 4.0
```

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Start filling the knapsack

| Step | Item   | Weight | Value | Remaining Capacity | Action                       | Added Value |
| :--- | :----- | :----: | :---: | :----------------: | :--------------------------- | :---------: |
| 1    | Item 1 |   10   |   60  |         50         | Fits completely              |     +60     |
| 2    | Item 2 |   20   |  100  |         40         | Fits completely              |     +100    |
| 3    | Item 3 |   30   |  120  |         20         | Only 20/30 fits (fractional) |     +80     |

**Explanation for Step 3:**

* Knapsack has **50 capacity**.
* After taking Item 1 (10) → remaining = 40
* After taking Item 2 (20) → remaining = 20
* Now Item 3 weighs 30 but only 20 can fit →
  Fraction = 20 / 30 = 0.6667 (≈ 66.67%)
  So we take **66.67% of Item 3’s value** →
  `120 × 0.6667 = 80`

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Total Value

| Item Taken                              | % Taken | Value Added |
| :-------------------------------------- | :-----: | :---------: |
| Item 1                                  |   100%  |      60     |
| Item 2                                  |   100%  |     100     |
| Item 3                                  |  66.67% |      80     |
| **Total Value = 60 + 100 + 80 = 240** ✅ |         |             |

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Output Explanation

So, the program prints:

```
Took 100% of item (value=60.0, weight=10.0)
Took 100% of item (value=100.0, weight=20.0)
Took 66.67% of item (value=120.0, weight=30.0)

Maximum value in Knapsack = 240.00
```

---

## 🧠 Why this works (Logic Explanation)

* The **greedy method** picks the **most valuable items per kg** first.
* It **doesn’t check all combinations** (like dynamic programming),
  it just keeps choosing the next best ratio.
* Since we can take **fractions**, this strategy gives the **optimal answer** for the fractional case.

---

### 🔹 Formula Recap

If item fits completely:

```
total_value += value
capacity -= weight
```

If item fits partially:

```
fraction = remaining_capacity / weight
total_value += value * fraction
capacity = 0
```

---

### 🔹 Final Answer

✅ **Maximum value = 240**
✅ **Items taken:**

* 100% of Item 1
* 100% of Item 2
* 66.67% of Item 3

Would you like me to show the **same explanation but for a different example** (like when the highest ratio item doesn’t fit at all first)?
That helps you understand how fractions are applied differently.
